# Real-Time-Object-Detection-System
Object detection is a technology, combined with computer vision and deep learning, provides advance features in various fields of automation. These computer vision and object recognition tasks enhances automatic robot machines carrying out large amount of work in a small or no time reducing human effort.

I’ll be using YOLOv3 in this project, in particular, YOLO trained on the COCO dataset.

The YOLOv3 object detector pre-trained (on the COCO dataset) model files. These were trained by the Darknet team.
